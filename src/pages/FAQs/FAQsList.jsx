		title: "What can we do with these genetic score models?",
		type: "gen_q",
		text: <>
			These genetic score models can be used to predict levels of biomolecular traits in genotyped cohorts. The predicted levels can be associated with complex phenotypes, which offer a useful tool to investigate the molecular underpinnings of these phenotypes. The predicted levels can also allow integrative analyses with other available biomolecular traits in the cohort.<br />
			Alternatively, genetic score models can be applied directly to genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics without the need for individual-level data using tools like S-PrediXcan.

				You can find download links on the Dataset, Platform and Publication pages. You can also find the links on the <Href key='download' href='/downloads' text='Downloads page'/>.<br />
				The genetic scores are mainly under the category <span className="fw-bold" key='pgsc_calc_file'>Scoring files<small> (pgsc_calc compatible)</small></span>.
				Each of these zipped files contains all the scoring files associated with a dataset/platform and are compatible with the <Href href='https://pgsc-calc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/' text='pgsc_calc'/> tool.<br/>

      title: "What method was used for genetic score development and why?",
      type: "score_dev",
      text: "The machine learning method Bayesian Ridge(BR), that based on individual - level genotype data, was used to construct genetic scores of biomolecular traits in the Atlas. Because it has been shown to perform well relative to other genetic score development approaches in both the previous study (Xu et al. Cell Genomics, 2022) and the benchmark carried out in this study. Additionally, Bayesian ridge has been shown to scale well to large numbers of traits, thus improving computational efficiency and consistency with green computing (Lannelongue et al. Advanced Science, 2021).",

      text: "To ensure the generalizability of genetic score models when applied to other cohorts, a variant filtering step was first performed for all the traits considered, which applied a MAF threshold of 0.5% and excluded all multi-allelic variants as well as ambiguous variants (i.e. A/T, G/C). A follow-up LD thinning step was carried out at an r2 threshold of 0.8 on all the variants, which aims to remove a certrain level of LD dependencies among variants and reduce the computational burden of genetic scoring method. The remaining variants were then filtered at the genome-wide significance threshold of 5e-8 (based on their GWAS summary statistics conducted on the INTERVAL training samples) for each trait. ",
